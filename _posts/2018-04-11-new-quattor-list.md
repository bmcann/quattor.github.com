Because of some policy changes at SourceForge, it was decided to replace all the existing Quattor mailing lists
at SourceForge by a [new forum][quattor-list] hosted by Google Groups. If you want to stay up-to-date with Quattor,
be sure to register to the new list either through the web interface or by sending an email to
[quattor+subscribe@groups.google.com](mailto:quattor+subscribe@groups.google.com).
