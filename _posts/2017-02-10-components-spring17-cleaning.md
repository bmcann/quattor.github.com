title: Components Spring 2017 Cleaning

# Goal

With the advent of build-tools version 1.52,
some code cleanup and refactoring is recommended.

This document explains how to cleanup the components;
the cleanup of the other core modules is not handled.

The minimal requirement is to bump `build-tools` in `pom.xml`
to at least 1.52 (under `/project/parent/version`) using

```
mvn versions:update-parent
```

# Warnings fail tests

A warning raised during tests will make the test fail.
It is also recommended that all perl unit tests (the `.t` files in `src/test/perl`)
have following header (and no perl shebang):

```perl
use strict;
use warnings;
```

# 00-tqu

We introduce a new basic perl unit test called `00-tqu.t` referring to
the usage of the [`Test::Quattor::Unittest`][tqu] module.

Adding it is easy:

```
echo 'use Test::Quattor::Unittest;' > src/test/perl/00-tqu.t
```

If the component has no dedicated `.pod` file(s)
(i.e. when all pod information is inline with the perl module),
you need to use

```
echo 'use Test::Quattor::Unittest qw(nopod);' > src/test/perl/00-tqu.t
```

The unit tests replaces a number of (possible) existing tests that can be removed

1. `00-load`: basic load test. Typically (and by default), only the component module is loaded
2. `pod-syntax`: basic pod syntax test.
3. `00-tt`: when relevant, the TT unit test is replaced (looks for existence of `src/main/resources`)

It also adds a `critic` test and a `perltidy` test. (For now, the `perltidy` test always passes).

# Perl module cleanup

## Header
Replace header with maven template

```perl
#${PMcomponent}
```

For components with their own namespace, use PMpre/post header
(space after `PMpre` is required)

```perl
#${PMpre} NCM::Component::<namespace::modulename>${PMpost}
```

## Unused and duplicate code

Remove unused / duplicate code

 * header above includes `use strict` and `use warnings`
 * check for unused CCM modules
  * `CCM::Element` by default imports `unescape`, so check for its usage before removing

## Parenting
Replace old parenting construct `@ISA` with `use parent`, e.g.

```perl
use NCM::Component;
our @ISA = qw(NCM::Component);
```

with

```perl
use parent qw(NCM::Component);
```

## CCM (un)escape
The CCM functions `escape` and/or `unescape`
have to be imported from `EDG::WP4::CCM::Path`
(instead of `CCM::Element`).


## Other changes
 * whitespace changes: switch to 4-space indent
 * for any other fixes/cleanup/refactor, ideally use other PR or at least separate commit to fix them

# Pan cleanup

## Remove legacy templates
No more `-common.pan` and / or `-rpms.pan`;
most components only have `config.pan` and `schema.pan`.
Make sure to double-check their content
so any non-standard definitions are added in the new `config.pan`

## `config.pan`
Start with the config header the maven template `${componentconfig}`.
This maven template includes the schema and the bind to `/software/components` and
adds the component as a versioned package to `/software/packages`.

It also generates pan component code with a prefix.
All values are set as default values, so they can be changed if needed.

`spma` is the only pre-dependency and last entry in the maven template.
If you don't want this dependency or require others, you can use another
maven template `${componentconfignospma}` to avoid the spma pre-dependency.
(It is the only difference with `${componentconfig}`).

Most components will only have the maven template for the whole `config.pan`.

## `schema.pan`
Replace header (including `declaration template ...`) with `${componentschema}`

Try to get rid of `include 'quattor/schema';`.
Components typically only requires `include 'quattor/types/component';`.

Remove any `bind` statement (typically at the end)
and rename the main component type to `${project.artifactId}_component`
(this is the type used in by the bind in `config.pan`).

## Add a unittest
Check if there is a perl unit test that tests `config.pan`.

Look for an object template in `src/test/resources` that includes `config.pan` and
a perl unit test in `src/test/perl`
that has `use Test::Quattor qw(<unittestobjecttemplate>);`

If not, look for an object template that is used in a perl unittest
and add:

```pan
function pkg_repl = { null; };
include 'components/<componentname>/config';
'/software/components/<componentname>/dependencies' = null;
```
